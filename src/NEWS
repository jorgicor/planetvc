	* Version 1.12

	* Fixed opening files on Windows when the path has something like TÃ¶.
	SDL was returning the path as UTF-8 but Windows' fopen does not
	support this, we need to use _wfopen and translate the UTF-8 string
	to wide characters.

	* Version 1.10

	* Fixed wrong pixels when enabling Stargate symbols.

	* kernel.c: we use a texture one pixel bigger than the game canvas, so
	we avoid strange pixels bleeding on the top and left from the bottom
	and right of the texture, probably only when linear filtering is on.

	* log.c (log_init): using explicit format string for fprintf to fix
	security warnings.

	* main.c: including SDL.h so that main become SDL_main on Android.

This is version 4.3.13 of libxmp-lite. It's under MIT/Expat license. See
README .

This is not the original package bundled by the authors. For that, visit
http://xmp.sourceforge.net .

I embedded the package in the game, following the autotools guidelines. Things
were working fine on Linux, but on Windows I had problems. The same happened
when I tried to run "make dist" . These problems were due to my lack of
knowledge only. So bassically I have taken all the .c and .h files, I have put
them in this folder and then I compile them with the game. In the Makefile.am
of the root folder you will see:

AM_CPPFLAGS = -DLIBXMP_CORE_PLAYER -DLIBXMP_CORE_DISABLE_IT -DBUILDING_STATIC

This is to enable or disable parts of the code that previously were done
with the 'configure' script of the package.

Apart from that I had to change some paths to some header files (for files
that were prevously under a 'loaders' folder).

Sorry.

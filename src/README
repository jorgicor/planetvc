This is README of The Planet of the Vicious Creatures source code.

Install
=======

We have two packages. One is planetvc, the other planetvc-data. 'planetvc'
builds the engine of the game. 'planetvc-data' contains the graphics, music,
levels, etc. of the game.  The game is separated in these two packages to allow
GNU/Linux distributions to separate them between free, non-free, etc. planetvc
is licensed under MIT/Expat, but planetvc-data (bmp, wav and xm files) is
CC-NC-SA.

Both packages come with a GNU build system, meaning that you can follow the
instructions in INSTALL to build and install the packages (that is, use a
simple './configure && make && make install' to install them).

Without options, the executable will install in /usr/bin and the game data
will install in /usr/share/planetvc-data . The executable expects the game
data on that folder.

You can change where to install the game by passing --prefix to the configure
script. For example, using './configure --prefix=/usr/local' will install in
/usr/local. But remember to pass the same prefix to the configure script of
the 'planetvc-data' package, so it installs in the same places.

Requirements
============

For GNU/Linux, you will need the SDL2 library installed on your system,
version 2.0.5.

Configure options
=================

--enable-sdl-datadir

	By default the executable is compiled to look for the data in
$(datadir)/planetvc-data, where datadir is by default /usr/share or whatever
you used when using the configure script. To make the program look for the
data in the places where the SDL library tells us instead, we use this flag.
For example, for GNU/Linux and Windows, if configuring using this flag, the
game executable will try to open the data in the same folder of the
executable. (This is used to make standalone binary distributions).

--enable-x11

	By default the game does not link with the X11 library, as this is
done dinamically if needed by the SDL library. But if the program refuses to
start with the error 'XDM authorization key matches an existing client!', it
is because you are using the XDM login manager, and in that case you can link
with the X11 library by using this command option and the game will run.
	The solution used in the standalone binary distributions of the game
has been to compile a patched version of the SDL 2 library to bypass this, and
bundle it with the game, so the game does not depend on any version of the X
library. But if you are compiling for yourself, then there is no problem in
using this flag if you get that XDM error.

--enable-debugmode

	Adds some debugging for synchronization of dragons and lava tongues.

--enable-demoversion

	Compiles a demo version of the program. Only useful for the author.
Will require a demo version of the game data.

--enable-phone-mode

	Simulates the build for mobile phones.

libxmp-lite
===========

The source code of libxmp-lite is embedded. Its license is MIT.  It is used to
play xm tracker files.

Some of the compilation flags that we use in Makefile.am - AM_CPPFLAGS are for
the use of this library only:

AM_CPPFLAGS = -DLIBXMP_CORE_PLAYER -DLIBXMP_CORE_DISABLE_IT -DBUILDING_STATIC

Compiling on Windows
====================

Install cygwin with i686-w64-ming32-gcc, bc.

Go to libsdl.org and download the development libraries for mingw.

Inside cygwin terminal and inside the sdl libraries folder type 'make native':
this will install the SDL library.

Then compile the project with:
./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --enable-sdl-datadir
make

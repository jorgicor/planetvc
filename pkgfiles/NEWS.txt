	* Version 1.05

	* The GNU/Linux package now includes executables for 32 and 64 bits,
	  as well as a precompiled SDL2 library for 32 and 64 bits.
	  'planetvc' is now a script that selects between the 32 or the
	  64 bits executable. The executables and library have been compiled
	  on Ubuntu 12.04.  Because of this, they require a GNU/Linux
	  distribution with a GNU libc of version 2.15 at least.

	* Updated the README.txt to reflect these changes.

2017-05-14

	* Version 1.11

	* Released under MIT/Expat license, except the game assets.

2017-03-26

	* Version 1.10

	* Fixed wrong pixels when enabling Stargate symbols.

2017-03-01

	* Version 1.09

	* Added BEGINNER mode and a hi-score table for this mode.

	* Added Brazilian Portuguese, German and Russian translations.

	* Added volume option to the menu.

	* Changed the demo to show what you get with the full version.

	* Support for Android.

	* Removed the 'Stargate' symbols from portals by default. They can be
	  reactivated by writting 'stargate' at the main menu.

	* Added command line --filter and --scale options (see README - 11.
	  Command line arguments).

2016-12-30

	* Version 1.08

	* Fixed pixels that bleed on the top and left borders, form the bottom
	  and right borders, probably happening only when linear filtering is
	  on on Windows.

2016-09-09

	* Version 1.07

	* Added guide to modify the game: MODIFY.html .

	* Added required copyright notice for libxmp-lite in license file.

	* Removed references for itch.io or gamejolt.com in the versions for
	  Steam.

2016-08-24

	* Version 1.06

	* Fixed bug: disconnecting a gamepad while playing could cause
	  infinite loop.

	* Added gamecontrollerdb.txt, a file with default mappings for
	  joysticks and game controllers. The game loads it at start so there
	  should be better support for joysticks not previously recognized.

	* Better launch script for GNU/Linux. Now you can use the options:

	  --help to show the list of options;

	  --use-my-sdl to load the SDL library installed on your system
	  instead of the bundled one;

	  --m32 or --m64 to launch the 32-bits or 64-bits binary directly
	  without letting the script select one depending on your system.

	  The script now uses LD_PRELOAD instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

2016-08-05

	* Version 1.05

	* The GNU/Linux package now includes executables for 32 and 64 bits,
	  as well as a precompiled SDL2 library for 32 and 64 bits.
	  'planetvc' is now a script that selects between the 32 or the
	  64 bits executable. The executables and library have been compiled
	  on Ubuntu 12.04.  Because of this, they require a GNU/Linux
	  distribution with a GNU libc of version 2.15 at least.

	* Updated the README.txt to reflect these changes.

2016-07-29

	* Version 1.04

	* Reduced some collision boxes, people have a lot of problems with the
	  first wasps.

	* Fixes for Polish and Portuguese languages.

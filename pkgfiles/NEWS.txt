	* Version 1.06

	* Fixed bug: disconnecting a gamepad while playing could cause
	  infinite loop.

	* Added gamecontrollerdb.txt, a file with default mappings for
	  joysticks and game controllers. The game loads it at start so there
	  should be better support for joysticks not previously recognized.

	* Better support for GNU/Linux, now we use SDL_DYNAMIC_API to load the
	  bundled SDL library instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH which was failing in
	  some cases.

	* Better launch script for GNU/Linux. Now you can use the options:

	  --help to show the list of options;

	  --use-my-sdl to load the SDL library installed on your system
	  instead of the bundled one;

	  --m32 or --m64 to launch the 32-bits or 64-bits binary directly
	  without letting the script select one depending on your system.

	* Version 1.05

	* The GNU/Linux package now includes executables for 32 and 64 bits,
	  as well as a precompiled SDL2 library for 32 and 64 bits.
	  'planetvc' is now a script that selects between the 32 or the
	  64 bits executable. The executables and library have been compiled
	  on Ubuntu 12.04.  Because of this, they require a GNU/Linux
	  distribution with a GNU libc of version 2.15 at least.

	* Updated the README.txt to reflect these changes.

	* Version 1.04

	* Reduced some collision boxes, people have a lot of problems with the
	  first wasps.

	* Fixes for Polish and Portuguese languages.

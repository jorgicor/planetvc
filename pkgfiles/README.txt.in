1. Introduction
---------------

Portals were found on Earth long ago. We don't know who made them, but we
managed to make them work, as we discovered that they can teleport us to a
place were other portal exists. But to come back, we need to find a portal in
the destination connected to the original.

We needed a special group of astronauts willing to take the risks, and Johanna
Brahe always succeeded. So after we discovered a new destination, Gliese 581,
appropriate in terms of gravity, geology and atmosphere, we offered her the new
mission, and she accepted.

--------------
2. How to play
--------------

Side note: You can switch between full screen and a windowed mode by pressing
Alt + Enter at any time.

By default, you can move with the arrow keys of your keyboard:

ARROW UP    - JUMP
ARROW DOWN  - CROUCH
ARROW LEFT  - GO LEFT
ARROW RIGHT - GO RIGHT

You can press simultaneously UP and LEFT/RIGHT to jump in that direction.

Your play area is a single screen level. Always, to get to another level, you
need to take at least one oxygen bubble that you will find floating in the
air.

When you enter a level, your first job is to spot where the oxygen bubble is,
and think how you can reach it, using platforms and avoiding the vicious
creatures of the planet. If they touch you, you will be in serious peril, as
they can open a breach on your space suit. Don't fall into the water or into
the lava, this is mortal!

When you reach an active portal, you can travel through it by walking to their
center (not jumping).

If you think that you have made wrong moves and you are in a situation where
you think you can't succeed, you can press the 'RESTART' key, which defaults
to your keyboard key SPACE, to restart a level from the same point you
entered it. This way you can think again and try to learn the patterns without
losing any life. If you have been touched by a creature, or you fell into the
water or water, you can restart as well, but a life will be already lost.

No level is impossible, you have to think before acting and, of course, you
have to practice to train your skills. Little by little you will learn the
patterns and the first levels will seem to you very easy compared to the first
times you played, and you will finish them without thinking.

To help you try, you can use the 'PRACTICE MODE'. This mode is activated when
you press the number '0' (zero) on your keyboard. The level will restart, in
the same way as if you pressed 'RESTART', but this time, although you can
die, you will not lose any life. So you can try all the times you want until
you learn the patterns and master the jumps.

But in 'PRACTICE MODE' you can't pass to the next level. You will need to end
the 'PRACTICE MODE' by pressing '0' again, and finish the level normally.

In any case, if you find a level to be very difficult so you think it is even
impossible, you can always go to the game menu and select OPTIONS - DEMO. Here
you can see how every level in the game can be finished.

The game is difficult, but we ensure you that it can be finished. If other
people have done it, you can do it. Practice little by little each day and you
will see how you make progress.

                "YOU WANT FAME... WELL, FAME COSTS. AND RIGHT
                 HERE IS WHERE YOU START PAYING... IN SWEAT!"

3. Game-pads
------------

The game should work with game-pads. Use the digital or analog pads to move.
The rest of buttons are (you will need to find them in a compatible game-pad):

                        Xbox game-pad   Playstation game-pad

Jump                    A               Cross
Restart/Skip text       B               Circle
Practice mode           X               Square
In game menu/ESC        Y/START         Triangle/START/OPTIONS

The left and right buttons (the ones close to the left and right triggers) can
be used to crouch as well.

----------
4. Scoring
----------

When you are playing, you can see in the bottom right corner the number of
levels you finished and the total you need to win. When you die or finish the
game, you will be able to put your initials in the score table of the game!

------------
5. Languages
------------

The game comes in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese,
Italian, Polish, German, Russian and Latino sine flexio. You can change the
language on the main menu.

If you would like the game in your language, you can traslate it if you want
and I will add the translation to the game. I can send you the text file.
I will put you in the credits. The only restriction is that at this moment I
can only support new translations for languages that use the characters
already in the game, plus German characters and Russian (Cyrillic) characters.
For other languages, please let me know first.

-----------------------
7. Windows demo version
-----------------------

The files in the Windows demo version are:

planetvc.exe    Game executable.
data.pak        Demo game data.
README.txt      This file.
NEWS.txt        Latest changes.

README-gcdb.txt README fot gamecontrollerdb.txt .

The demo version only features the first 16 levels of the game. When you reach
the last level you will return to the main menu.

The full version of the game features 18 additional levels in two different
regions: the caverns and the lava region. In the demo version, if you go to
OPTIONS - DEMO, you can see the 16 levels of the demo plus one level of each
of the two additional regions.

8. GNU/Linux Version
--------------------

planetvc        Script to run the game.
README          This file.
README-SDL      README for SDL2 library.
README-gcdb     README fot gamecontrollerdb.txt .
NEWS            Latest changes.
FAQ             Frequently asked questions.
LICENSE         License.
ccncsa4.txt     Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4 license.
bin/
  data.pak      Game data.
  pvc32         32 bits game executable.
  pvc64         64 bits game executable.
  x86/          Contains a precompiled 32 bits SDL2 library.
  x86_64/       Contains a precompiled 64 bits SDL2 library.
  gamecontrollerdb.txt  Mappings for old joysticks.

Run the game using the script 'planetvc'. The script will select the correct
executable depending on your system: if you are on a 64 bits system it will
choose 'pvc32', otherwise it will choose pvc64.

The script gives priority to the precompiled SDL2 library bundled with the
game (in the folders x86/ and x86_64/). These libraries will be selected
instead of the ones on your system. If you want to give priority to the SDL2
library on your system, run pvc32 or pvc64 directly.

The game requires a glibc at version 2.15 at least.
I have tested the game in Ubuntu 12.04 and Slackware 14.1, on 32 and 64 bits.
Both distributions, if they have the full updates, meet the glibc requisite.

IMPORTANT: The GNU/Linux version is not supported! I can't guarantee that it
will work on the millions of distributions out there. Of course, you can send
me bug reports and, if time permits I can try to solve the problems if I know
how!

--------------
9. Other files
--------------

The game will create this little files on your system:

prefs.txt       Selected game keys and language.
hiscore.txt     Table with scores.
log.txt         Game log, to spot errors. (It won't be more than 8 KB).
log.txt.1       Backup of the last log.txt. (It won't be more than 8 KB).

- On Windows Vista and up, these files will be created in:

        C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\jorgicor\planetvc

  or, on Windows XP in:

	C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\jorgicor\planetvc

  where [username] is your user name on Windows. Note that 'Users', 'AppData',
  and 'Application Data' can be translated on your system to your local
  language.

- On Linux, these will be in:

        /home/[username]/.local/share/jorgicor/planetvc/"

  where [username] is your user name on Linux.

You can remove the 'planetvc' folder on any system if you don't plan to play
the game again.

If you want to reset the table of scores, you only need to remove the file
'hiscore.txt'.

----------------------
11. Modifying the game
----------------------

In the full version of the game, the file 'data.pak' is no more than a ZIP
file. You can modify and share it respecting the license.  The game is able to
read the files from inside the 'data.pak' or you can extract the files and the
game will read them individually. To make this work, if normally the game
follows this structure:

planetvc.exe
data.pak

If you want to work with the extracted files, you have to unzip 'data.pak'
into a folder named 'data'. So the final structure will be:

planetvc.exe
data.pak
data\

And inside the folder data\ will be the files that were inside 'data.pak'.

Finally, you have to remove 'data.pak' (or better rename it) because the game
prioritizes the pak over individual files.

If you want to modify the files and make a new 'data.pak' for sharing
(following the license) you have to create a new ZIP file named 'data.pak'
with all the files inside the folder data\ without compression, that is,
telling your ZIP software to only store the files. Do not add the folder data\
to the ZIP file, just the files inside it.

Documentation on how to modify the game or write new levels is found in the
file MODIFY.html which comes with the full version of the game. You can find
it online too at http://jorgicor.sdfeu.org/planetvc/modify.html .

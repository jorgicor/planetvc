If you are a package maintainer for a Linux distro, and you want to include
the game, you only need to get `src/` to build the game, and either take the
`data/` folder for the game assets, or use `./mkdatapak` to create a
`data.pak` file inside `datapak/`, and use the scripts in `datapak/` to
install the assets as if it were an autotools source code package. For more
info read README in `src/` and `datapak`.

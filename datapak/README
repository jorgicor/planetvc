This is README of planetvc-data package.

Install
=======

We have two packages. One is planetvc, the other planetvc-data. 'planetvc'
builds the engine of the game. 'planetvc-data' contains the graphics, music,
levels, etc. of the game.  The game is separated in these two packages to allow
GNU/Linux distributions to separate them between free, non-free, etc. planetvc
is MIT/Expat licensed, but planetvc-data (bmp, wav and xm files) is CC-NC-SA.

Both packages come with a GNU build system, meaning that you can follow the
instructions in INSTALL to build and install the packages (that is, use a
simple './configure && make && make install' to install them).

Without options, the executable will install in /usr/bin and the game data
will install in /usr/share/planetvc-data . The executable expects the game
data on that folder.

You can change where to install the game by passing --prefix to the configure
script. For example, using './configure --prefix=/usr/local' will install in
/usr/local. But remember to pass the same prefix to the configure script of
the 'planetvc-data' package, so it installs in the same places.
